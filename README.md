# Python-Portfolio
Welcome to my python portfolio! A collection of my projects in python, showcasing my skills in data cleaning, ecploratory data analysis(EDA) and data visualization. Each project includes detailed jupyter notebooks and explanations to demonstrate my approach and methodology.

## Projects
+ Project: Covid19 Analysis
  - Description: This project analyzes the impact of COVID-19 while integrating the World Happiness Report to explore potential correlations between pandemic severity and global well-being. The data cleaning process involved handling missing values, standardizing formats, and merging three datasets: [confirmed infections](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Covid19%20Analysis/covid19_Confirmed_dataset.csv), [confirmed deaths](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Covid19%20Analysis/covid19_deaths_dataset.csv), and the [World Happiness Report](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Covid19%20Analysis/worldwide_happiness_report.csv). Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), key insights into case trends, mortality rates, and country-wise variations were uncovered.
  - Skills Used: Data Cleaning, DataFrame Merging, Data Exploration, Data Visualization.
  - Libararies Used: Pandas, Numoy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

+ Project: Customer Call List
  - Description: This project involves Data Cleaning in Pandas, where [raw customer call data](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Customer%20Call%20List/Customer%20Call%20List.xlsx) was processed and prepared for further analysis.The dataset includes information on customer name, phone number, address, etc.
  - Skills Used: Removing Duplicates, Dropping Columns, Removing Unwanted Characters, Spliting Columns, Removing Nulls.

+ Project: Ultra Marathon
  - Description: This project involves cleaning and exploring [>7 million rows of ultra marathon data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/discussion/420633), aiming to uncover trends and insights related to athlete performance, race completion times, and participation patterns. Visualizations were created to highlight key statistics and distributions.
  - Skills Used: Merge, Groupby, reset_index, describe, Data Explorationm Data Visualization.
  - Libraries Used: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
  - [View analysis on events in the USA](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Ultra%20Marathon/ultra_marathon_EDA.ipynb)
  - [View analysis focused on Indian athletes](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Ultra%20Marathon/data_exploration_indian_athletes.ipynb)

+ Project: World Population
  - Description: This project involves cleaning and transforming [world population data](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Python-Portfolio/blob/main/World%20Population/world_population.csv), and analyzing the population data. We examine population trends over time, correlation between population and demographic, growth, density and distribution across countries.
  - Skills Used: Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data Visualization.
  - Libraries Used: Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib.
