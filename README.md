# Python-Portfolio
Welcome to my python portfolio! A collection of my projects in python, showcasing my skills in data cleaning, ecploratory data analysis(EDA) and data visualization. Each project includes detailed jupyter notebooks and explanations to demonstrate my approach and methodology.

## Projects
+ Project: Covid19 Analysis
  - Description: This project analyzes the impact of COVID-19 while integrating the World Happiness Report to explore potential correlations between pandemic severity and global well-being. The data cleaning process involved handling missing values, standardizing formats, and merging three datasets: [confirmed infections](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Covid19%20Analysis/covid19_Confirmed_dataset.csv), [confirmed deaths](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Covid19%20Analysis/covid19_deaths_dataset.csv), and the [World Happiness Report](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Covid19%20Analysis/worldwide_happiness_report.csv). Through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), key insights into case trends, mortality rates, and country-wise variations were uncovered.
  - Skills Used: Data Cleaning, DataFrame Merging, Data Exploration, Data Visualization.
  - Libararies Used: Pandas, Numoy, Seaborn, Matplotlib.

+ Project: Customer Call List
  - Description: This project involves Data Cleaning in Pandas, where [raw customer call data](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Customer%20Call%20List/Customer%20Call%20List.xlsx) was processed and prepared for further analysis.The dataset includes information on customer name, phone number, address, etc.
  - Skills Used: Removing Duplicates, Dropping Columns, Removing Unwanted Characters, Spliting Columns, Removing Nulls.
