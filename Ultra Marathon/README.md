## Dataset Details
This [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aiaiaidavid/the-big-dataset-of-ultra-marathon-running/discussion/420633), uploaded to kaggle by David,
is a huge collection of over 7 million ultra marathon race records registered between 1798 and 2022.

## Project Overview
I have done the analysis in two parts.
- For race events in USA. ([view notebook](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Ultra%20Marathon/ultra_marathon_EDA.ipynb))
- For Indian Athlete participation. ([view notebook](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Ultra%20Marathon/data_exploration_indian_athletes.ipynb))

### Ultra-Marathon Events in the USA: Key Insights Report
###  **1. Objective**
This report explores ultra-marathon events in the USA, focusing on 50km and 50-mile races held in 2020. The goal is to analyze participation trends, performance metrics, and the impact
  of external factors on race results.
### **2. Data Overview**
- **Key Columns:** Event Name, Year, Location, Distance, Finishing Time, Gender, Age Group.
- **Filtered Events:** Only races categorized under "USA" and held in 2020 were included.
### **3. Key Insights and Trends**
#### **Participation Trends**
- Races were concentrated in states like California, Colorado, and Texas.
- The **50km** race had higher participation than the **50-mile** category.
#### **Performance Trends**
- **Finishing Times:** Male participants had lower finishing times compared to female participants.
- **Age Impact:** Younger runners (<35) had faster times, while older athletes (>50) excelled in endurance.
- **Seasonal Influence:** Performance improved in cooler months, highlighting the role of climate in endurance events.
### **4. Conclusion and Recommendations**
- **Training Strategies:** Athletes should adjust training plans based on seasonal trends.
- **Event Scheduling:** Organizers should consider cooler months for better race outcomes.
- **Further Analysis:** Additional research on terrain, altitude, and nutrition could provide deeper insights into performance factors.

### Ultra Marathon Athletes of Indian Origin: Key Insights Report
### **1. Objective**
This report analyzes **Indian-origin ultra-marathon athletes**, focusing on key race categories such as **50km, 100km, 12-hour, and 24-hour races**. The aim is to identify participation trends, performance patterns, and influencing factors.

### **2. Data Overview**
- **Key Columns:** Athlete Name, Age, Gender, Race Category, Finishing Time, Year, Location.
- **Filtered Data:** Only athletes from India were considered, and less relevant race categories were excluded.

### **3. Key Insights & Trends**
#### **Participation Trends**
- The **100km race** had the highest participation, followed by the 50km category.
- Indian athletes are increasingly participating in global ultra-marathon events.
- The **male-to-female participation ratio is ~3:1**, indicating a gender gap in endurance racing.

#### **Performance Trends**
- **Finishing Times:** Younger athletes (<35) had better times, while older athletes (>50) excelled in longer-duration races.
- **Seasonal Impact:** Runners performed better in **cooler months (Nov-Feb)** compared to summer races.
- **Endurance Events:** Older athletes showed greater resilience in 12-hour and 24-hour race formats.

### **4. Conclusion & Recommendations**
- **Encouraging Participation:** More efforts are needed to promote gender inclusivity in ultra-marathons.
- **Optimizing Training Plans:** Indian athletes should align training schedules with seasonal performance trends.
- **Further Research:** Additional factors such as environmental conditions, global race participation, and athlete training regimens could provide deeper insights into ultra-endurance success.
