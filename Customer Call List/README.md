## Dataset Details
This [dataset](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Customer%20Call%20List/Customer%20Call%20List.xlsx) contains raw customer call data. Each entry contains information like customer name, phone number, address, paying customer, and permission to contact
them in future.

## Project Overview
I cleaned and processed a [raw dataset](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Python-Portfolio/blob/main/Customer%20Call%20List/Customer%20Call%20List.xlsx) using Pandas to ensure data quality and consistency. The cleaning steps included removing duplicates, handling missing values, 
dropping unnecessary columns, and standardizing text fields such as names and phone numbers. I also performed string manipulations to remove unwanted characters and 
formatted key attributes for uniformity. These preprocessing steps ensured that the data was ready for further analysis, enabling accurate insights and better 
decision-making.
