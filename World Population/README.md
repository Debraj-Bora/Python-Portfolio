### Dataset Details  
This [dataset](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Python-Portfolio/blob/main/World%20Population/world_population.csv) contains global population data for 234 countries, covering population figures from 1970 to 2022, along with geographical attributes like continent, area, and population density.  

### Project Overview  
The dataset was cleaned and analyzed to identify global population trends, growth patterns, and country-wise distributions. Key insights include growth rates, population density variations, and continent-wise trends.  

#### **Key Analysis Performed:**  
- **Data Cleaning:** Handled missing values, converted data types, and standardized formats.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Trend analysis of population growth over decades.  
  - Density and area comparisons among countries.  
  - Continent-wise population distribution.  
  - Identified the highest and lowest growth rates.  
  - **Correlation Heatmap:** A heatmap was created to visualize relationships between key features like population, area, density, and growth rate, revealing strong correlations between population and density while highlighting other interesting patterns.

### **Libraries Used:** Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
